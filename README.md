# Dotfiles

My dotfiles repository, used by me.

Inspired by [Freek Murze](https://github.com/freekmurze). It contains all of my (except private) tools, aliases and some functions.

I use ZSH with Oh My Zsh using the Powerlevel10k theme.

Installing is as easy as cloning this repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and run the bootstrap script as follows:
```
git clone git@github.com:bjarn/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```
